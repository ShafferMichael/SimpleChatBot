# Welcome to the AI Chatbot!

This code defines a class called `BotAttributes` that represents an AI chatbot. The chatbot is able to hold a conversation with a user, responding to their input with a combination of pre-defined responses and responses generated by a deep learning model. The chatbot is also able to generate nonverbal responses, such as nodding or smiling, to give the impression of a more natural conversation.

To use the chatbot, simply run the code and follow the prompts in the terminal. You can exit the conversation by saying "bye", "goodbye", or "see you later".

This chatbot was built as a student project using the **TensorFlow** library for deep learning and natural language processing. We are enthusiastic about the possibilities of AI and are excited to continue exploring and learning about this field. The model was trained on a dataset of conversation transcripts and is able to generate responses based on the context of the conversation.

We hope you enjoy chatting with our AI chatbot!
